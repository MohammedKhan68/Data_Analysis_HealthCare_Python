# Health Data Analysis Project 🩺📊

This project explores a health dataset using Python and pandas, with visualizations created in Seaborn and Matplotlib. The main goal was to uncover patterns and answer meaningful questions about health metrics such as cholesterol, blood pressure, age, gender, and BMI.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Does age have a correlation with cholesterol levels?
- Is there a significant difference in blood pressure between males and females?
- How does BMI differ between males and females?
- Where is the population most densely distributed in terms of health indicators?

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `health_analysis.py` – Python script with data analysis and visualizations
- `README.md` – This file

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is also referenced and structured in my **SQL GitHub repository**:

🔗 **[SQL Health Dataset Repo](https://github.com/your-username/sql-health-dataset)**  
> Contains raw data, table structures, and sample queries used before data was exported for this project.

## 📊 Techniques & Tools Used

- **Pandas**: Data loading, cleaning, grouping, summarizing
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Visualization (scatter plots, regression plots, line plots)
- **Groupby & Aggregation**: To explore patterns by age, gender, etc.
- **Correlation Analysis**: To identify statistical relationships
